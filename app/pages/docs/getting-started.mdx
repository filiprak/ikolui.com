## New Project

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - `20.x or newer` (but we recommend the active LTS release)
- **Text editor** - There is no IDE requirement, but we recommend Visual Studio Code with the official Vue extension (previously known as Volar) or WebStorm, which, along with other JetBrains IDEs, offers great Nuxt support right out-of-the-box.
- **Terminal** - In order to run Nuxt commands
