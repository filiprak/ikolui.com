## Philosophy

ikol UI is guided by four core principles:

1. **Beauty** – Interfaces should be visually pleasing without relying on flashy effects. Aesthetic simplicity enhances user experience.  
2. **Minimalism** – Less is more. Every element has a purpose. Avoid clutter and unnecessary design noise.  
3. **Simplicity** – Components should be intuitive and easy to implement, even for developers new to Vue.  
4. **Consistency** – Uniform styling and behavior across all components create a predictable and reliable interface for users.  

These principles are reflected in every component. By focusing on clarity and ease of use, ikol UI enables developers to focus on building functionality rather than wrestling with styles.
