# Getting started

## Play online

If you just want to play around with Nuxt in your browser without setting up a project, you can use one of our online sandboxes:

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js - 20.x or newer (but we recommend the active LTS release)
- Text editor - There is no IDE requirement, but we recommend Visual Studio Code with the official Vue extension (previously known as Volar) or WebStorm, which, along with other JetBrains IDEs, offers great Nuxt support right out-of-the-box.
- Terminal - In order to run Nuxt commands

## Development Server

Now you'll be able to start your Nuxt app in development mode:
